# What is Redstone API

Redstone API is a Javascript library for fetching trusted token pricing data from the [Redstone data ecosystem](https://github.com/redstone-finance/redstone-api/blob/main/docs/REDSTONE_DATA_ECOSYSTEM.md).

It is implemented as a Javascript wrapper for the [Redstone HTTP Api](http-api/prices/).

## ✅ Why Redstone API

### ✓ Secure

Redstone pricing data is secured on the [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/) chain and protected by the provider's collateral. [Learn more](https://github.com/redstone-finance/redstone-api/blob/main/docs/REDSTONE_DATA_ECOSYSTEM.md)
